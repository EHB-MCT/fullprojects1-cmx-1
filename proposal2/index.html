				<h3>YOUR STORY MAKES A DIFFERENCE</h2>
				<p>
					For celebrating our 10 year anniversary, we put our connection,
					support and creating an inclusive community in the spotlight! That's
					why we believe in the power of stories: stories that not only inspire,
					but also show the impact of the activities we undertake together.
					Today we want to invite you, our volunteers and newcomers, to share
					your unique experience with partnering with us!

				<h3>WHY YOUR TESTIMONY MATTERS</h2>
				<p>
					We not only want to hear your story, but also share it. By sharing
					your experience, you can encourage others to join our organization,
					whether that means becoming a volunteer, participating in our
					activities, or simply making new meaningful friendships. Your
					contribution could be the key to creating an even stronger and more
					connected community.
